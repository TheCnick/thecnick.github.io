...a singular occurrence. It has taken me some weeks to settle my thoughts into an order which can be articulated. I should detail all the facts of the matter but confess myself incapable to the task. And in any case (dear --), I feel uncertain of their reception. We but do with what we are given. 


I had wanted to give amusement to my fellow man, to pry light from the shadows and bring it forth into the palms of our hands. I attempted to hover the magnifying over stories and oft-overlooked details so that life seemed more extraordinary than at first glance. To capture the animals--their anima, if you will (from which we get animation)--so that I could bring them to life was one of my chief desires/my life's goals. And through many a failed experiment, I have succeeded, I fear. The portrait is almost complete.

Now the hours creep in this petty place, or else they dash across the clock's face. I cannot/am unable to remember as if in a haze, a fog has filled the room and my head with it as well. I have but vague impressions of what I am supposed to do, of my work, of myself.

and I feel a presence--or perhaps, more accurately, presences--of persons unknown. At times it seems they follow me, watching. At other times, I scream into the void without a voice, a mouth, and there's nothing. They are all gone. Disappeared to where I know not.

That soft and pliable smile, the smile I had spent many an hour on now changed to a half-fiendish grin.

The days now (fast) bleed into each other. Memories once so vivid and fresh, like an impressionist's flowers, are now dull and bleak like a Turner A Seashore/Seascape/Hilly Landscape with Tower (by Turner).

Its very eyes seem now malevolent and with each passing day I can't make myself touch my hand nor my brush to its congealed surface. Its ire grows. Its condemning gaze follows me about the room. It's as if, and I shamed to confess it/and I burn to confess it/I shutter to confess it (* something that conveys embarrassment at the ill-logic of it all)--it's as if all the presences have manifested this, this entity within my painting./it's as if all the presences have combined/merged into this, this entity within my painting. I grow/I have grown worried/aware/weary that/of its/it's...
